# Geodesic-PCA-for-Riemannian-manifolds
This repository is an esssai to implement the Geodesic PCA Algorithm for Riemannian manifolds modulo isometric Lie group actions as Described On it's <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237813741_Intrinsic_shape_analysis_Geodesic_PCA_for_Riemannian_manifolds_modulo_isometric_Lie_group_actions">paper<a>, with a restriction to Space dimension (2D and 3D)

Please Note that the Code is not Clean, nor it is final as the algorithm's output wouldn't meet my initial expectation. You can contact me to write on this repo and finalise it
